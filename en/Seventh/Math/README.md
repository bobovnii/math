### Fractions, Decimals, Percentages
- Operations with fractions
  - Fraction Add/Subtract (12-button keypad)
    - Hint: Find a common denominator; simplify the result.
    - Example 1: 3/4 + 2/3 = ? -> 17/12
    - Example 2: 7/8 - 1/6 = ? -> 17/24
  - Fraction Multiply/Divide (12-button keypad)
    - Hint: Multiply across; for division, flip the second fraction.
    - Example 1: 2/5 × 3/4 = ? -> 3/10
    - Example 2: 5/6 ÷ 2/3 = ? -> 5/4 (or 1 1/4)
- Decimals and percentages
  - Percentage Change (6-button multiple choice)
    - Hint: Find the percent of the original, then add or subtract.
    - Example 1: Increase £120 by 10% -> £132
    - Example 2: Decrease 250 by 8% -> 230
  - Decimal Operations (12-button keypad)
    - Hint: Align decimal points for +/−; count decimal places for ×/÷.
    - Example 1: 4.8 + 3.17 = ? -> 7.97
    - Example 2: 6.4 ÷ 0.2 = ? -> 32

### Geometry
- Angles and polygons
  - Parallel Line Angles (6-button multiple choice)
    - Hint: Corresponding = equal; alternate = equal; co-interior = 180°.
    - Example 1: Alternate angle to 62° -> 62°
    - Example 2: Co-interior pair sums to 180°. If one is 105°, other? -> 75°
  - Interior/Exterior Polygons (6-button multiple choice)
    - Hint: Interior sum = (n-2)×180°; exterior angles total 360°.
    - Example 1: Interior angle of a regular octagon -> 135°
    - Example 2: Number of sides if each exterior angle is 30° -> 12
- Perimeter, area, circles
  - Area of Triangles/Parallelograms (12-button keypad)
    - Hint: Triangle = 1/2×b×h; parallelogram = b×h.
    - Example 1: Triangle b=12, h=7 -> 42
    - Example 2: Parallelogram b=9, h=6 -> 54
  - Circles: Circumference and Area (6-button multiple choice)
    - Hint: C ≈ πd; A ≈ πr² (use π≈3.14).

    - Example 2: Circle r=5 cm. Area? -> about 78.5 cm²

### Statistics & Probability
- Data and averages
  - Mean, Median, Mode (12-button keypad)
    - Hint: Mean = sum ÷ count; median = middle when ordered.

- Probability basics
  - Single-Event Probability (6-button multiple choice)
    - Hint: Probability = favourable / total outcomes.
    - Example 1: Rolling a 4 on a fair die -> 1/6
    - Example 2: Picking red from bag of 3 red, 5 blue -> 3/8
  - Experimental vs Theoretical (6-button multiple choice)
    - Hint: Theoretical uses ratios; experimental uses results.
    - Example 1: If a coin shows heads 7/10 times in trials, experimental probability? -> 0.7
    - Example 2: Theoretical probability of heads? -> 0.5

### Measurement & Compound Measures
- Speed, density, pressure style questions
  - Speed = Distance ÷ Time (12-button keypad)
    - Hint: Keep units consistent.
    - Example 1: 120 km in 3 h -> 40 km/h
    - Example 2: If speed 12 m/s for 30 s, distance? -> 360 m
- Unit conversions
  - Convert Units (12-button keypad)
    - Hint: Use 10/100/1000 for metric; use given factors if mixed.
